# DelawareBlockchain
A Git Repo for all the Blockchain goings on in Delaware
So I have made two contracts on the Ethereum testnet blockchain, I reccomend you connect with the Mist Ethereum Wallet as it is much easier than the command line version. 
All of the information I used to get to this point, including much the source code is located on https://www.ethereum.org/

Delaware Blockchain Congress: 0xf4fCa3051cBE1FE5a394B81768148Daf7cD6A2fe (testnet)
Delaware Blockchain Token (DEB) : 0xf4fCa3051cBE1FE5a394B81768148Daf7cD6A2fe (testnet)

these are just to play around with but you should be able to exchange testnet ethereum (which can be had for free from various "testnet ethereum faucets" online) into Delaware Blockchain Tokens to be used for future votes and to make proposals etc on the Delaware Blockchain. Eventually we can push this to the mainnet and possibly get donations etc in real ethereumn that we can then use to vote on projects, ventures etc.
Exciting times indeed!
